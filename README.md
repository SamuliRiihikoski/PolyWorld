New 3d modelling app. Testing on linux only but this should also work in Windows OS.

Done

- Proper mesh data structure (halfedge-based) 
- Add Cube for starting point for scene.
- Basic Ray/Triangle intersection detection works.
- Polygon selection (Colors the active polygon)

Backlog

- Extrude Polygon (ACTIVE)
- There is issue with two faces are close and viewing angle is high. Not selectin right face.
